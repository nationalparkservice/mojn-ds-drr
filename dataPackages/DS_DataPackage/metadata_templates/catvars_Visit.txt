DPL	Accepted	Data that have undergone all QA and QC procedures as defined in a published protocol and associated SOPs. Used in cases where a Quality Assurance Plan has not been developed and approved.
DPL	Provisional	Data that have undergone all planned QA procedures, have been entered into the system of record, and have passed verification procedures to ensure that data in the system of record match source data (field forms, sensor data files, etc.). Provisional data have not undergone all QC procedures
DPL	Raw	Data in their state of original collection, either in the form of paper or electronic field forms, eletronic sensor files, or digital media(photo, video, or audio). These data generally have been collected following some QA procedures, but have not undergone any QC procedures.
